# Shapping AI

## Shaping AI is a multi-national and multi-disciplinary social research project that examines the global trajectories of public discourse on artificial intelligence (AI) in four countries (Germany, UK, Canada and France) over a ten-year period 2012-2021

### Our comparative analysis will enable us to understand the differences and similarities in the construction of AI as a new scientific paradigm, societal force and contested political reality in these four countries by contextualizing their geo-political, historical and situational peculiarities. Funded by the European Open Research Area initiative for a period of three years (February 2021 - February 2024), Shaping AI brings together leading research teams from each of the four countries under scrutiny.

### Our project aims to be critical, comparative, qualitative, and to this end, we have adopted a four-dimensional research design, with the four teams collaborating to map and analyse AI controversies in and across four different spheres in which public discourse about AI has taken shape in the last ten years: media, policy, research and participation.

### The research on AI controversies in each of the four spheres is led by a different research team, with the study of "spill-over" controversies that have arisen between the spheres reserved for the second half of the project.
