Artificial Intelligence has been the subject of widespread public controversy in recent years, but are we
currently having the debates about AI that we will need to engage in as a society? During this design-led
research workshop, we invite experts in AI from different fields to work with us to address the following
question: how do we get from the AI controversies that we have today to the AI controversies that we
need?

Hosted by the ESRC-funded project Shaping AI, the workshop will include a presentation of a social study of AI
controversies (2017-2022). This will provide the basis for a collaborative research activity supported by
design methods. We will use a diagnostic tool to determine the "shape" of selected AI controversies: are recent
English-language controversies about AI in good or bad shape when it comes to participation, relevance,
engagement with social context, and the role of power? Based on our shared diagnoses, we will work together
to "re-shape" the selected disputes and formulate society-centric requirements for AI controversies to come.

### Practical Information

This participatory research workshop will take place at Friends House (173-177 Euston Rd, London NW1 2BJ).
The event will run from 10:00am to 5:00pm and catering will be provided.

### Workshop topic and purpose

The international social research project Shaping AI is currently conducting a comparative study of AI
controversies for the period 2012-2022 in four countries (Germany, France, UK and Canada). This on-going
study has highlighted the strong influence of promotional industry discourse on AI debates in research, media,
and public policy. Perhaps inevitably, discussions across these domains have been dominated by sensational
claims regarding the unprecedented predictive, diagnostic, and communicative capacities of Generative AI
(Castelle, 2020).

A related insight arising from Shaping AI's on-going research concerns the significant, and relatively sudden,
expansion of public policy debates in the area of “AI and society.” Here, AI discourse is generating an
abundance of “problematizations,” definitions of real and potential problems, threats, and harms (exploitation,
misinformation, privacy invasion, racism, bias, physical harm, cheating), to the point that assumed dynamics of
public policy discourse formation on technological risks (Stirling, 2008) — problem definition, problem
selection, prioritization, policy formulation and stabilization — do not appear to obtain in this case.

These two observations highlight the significant challenges involved in the development of robust and
comprehensive understandings of the new capabilities, benefits, risks and harms generated by AI as a strategic
area of research and innovation. Yet, precisely because of the emergence of unprecedented scientific and
technological capacities, and associated societal harms, benefits and risks, we as a society need clarity of vision,
focused debate, and critical intervention in relation to AI more than ever.

During this participatory research workshop, we therefore invite experts in AI and society from different areas
of expertise (science, media, policy, activism and the arts) to review Shaping AI's on-going analysis of AI
controversies, and specifically the UK team's study of English-language research controversies in the areas of AI
and/or AI and society. The provisional results of this study, which combines online consultation, social media
analysis and interviews, will provide the grounding for design-led collaborative inquiry into AI controversies
during the workshop, as we invite participants to work with us to address the question: how do we get from
the AI controversies that we currently have to the AI controversies that we need?

Using methods of “data physicalization” (Jansen et al, 2015), we have designed a 're-constructive' exercise of
shaping and re-shaping AI controversies: in two collaborative activities, we will collectively diagnose the state
of selected AI controversies, and on this basis, formulate requirements for AI controversies to come.

### Workshop activities

The workshop will consist of three parts: presentation, shaping, and re-shaping of AI controversies. During the
first designed activity (“Shaping AI”), we will work in small groups to determine the state of selected AI
controversies. To make this task feasible, we have identified a set of exemplary research controversies about AI
that took place in English-language media during the period 2017-2022. Using a diagnostic tool that has been
specifically designed for this purpose - the “controversy shape shifter”- we will interpret a document “dossier”
that the Shaping AI team has created for each controversy, and, on this basis, evaluate the controversy in
question along a diverse set of axes of interpretation (relevance, power, situatedness, agency). This will then
allow us to determine this controversy's "shape." Once we have settled on these shapes of the selected AI
controversies, we will take up methods of participatory design to re-shape these controversies, projecting their
desired features and formulate requirements and needs for AI controversies to come. We will thus use dataintensive,=
participatory design methods in order to evaluate the precise ways in which the selected AI
controversies can be considered to be in "bad shape" — or, possibly, in better shape than expected — and to
determine the features of the AI research controversies that will need to take place in years to come.
Participants

For this workshop we have invited UK-based experts in AI and society from science, the humanities, public
policy, journalism, activism and the arts. Several of our participants have contributed to the online expert
consultation on important but overlooked AI controversies that the Shaping AI team conducted in the autumn
of 2021.

### Outputs

We will produce a short visual workshop report summarising the workshop findings and insights. During the
workshop, we will discuss the possibility of a co-authored journal article on Shifting AI Controversies.
